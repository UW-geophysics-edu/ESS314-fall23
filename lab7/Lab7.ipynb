    "Despite the added complication of the latitude dependence of magnetic data, you can see that manipulating a simple rectangular body in the subsurface affects magnetic measurements similarly to how it affects gravity measurements. This also means that magnetic surveys have the same problem as gravity surveys: there are multiple subsurface models that can fit the same data set, the inverse problem is not unique. Therefore, the effectiveness of a magnetic study depends on whether there is previous geologic knowledge of the area.\n",

Your colleagues already found one wall extending East/West, composed of basalt. Now you are conducting a magnetic survey to find more walls. You take 101 measurements in a South/North trending line. The results are in `ArchealogicalData.txt` that can be read through `pandas`. We will use Harmonica to model the magnetic data.\n",

Scripts below define a `region` of 100x100 meters: 100 meters in both x and y direction (horizontal). The `shape` parameter defines who many points to measure in the defined region, which in this case, 101 measurement in both x and y direction. Then we would have gravity measurement at `x = [0,1,2,...,100]` and `y = [0,1,2,...,100]`."
